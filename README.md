Sharing a tool to get GPU information from Intel and Apple silicon based macs. 
This tool is used with telegraf to populate an Influxdb bucket to display stats in grafana;

Disclaimer, this code has been tested on: 

 * Intel Mac Pro with AMD Radeon Pro W6600
 * Apple Silicon Macbook M1 Ultra
  
 It hasn't been tested on multi-gpu setup but should be quite easily adapted.



## Installation process

* Copy **gpuPerformanceStatistics** to */usr/local/bin*
* Update your **telegraf.conf** accordingly (see example bellow)
* Restart telegraf 
* Update and use provided grafana dashboard json as template
* Enjoy

GPU performance statistics are exported using Apple IOKitframework as a JSON. 

Telegraf is configured to invoke **gpuPerformanceStatistics** (command line app) and parse the JSON output to ingest all available fields.

Here's an example of **telegraf.conf** 

```
[[inputs.execd]]
  command = ["/usr/local/bin/gpuPerformanceStatistics", "IOAccelerator"]
  name_override = "macosgpu"
  signal = "none"
  restart_delay = "10s"
  data_format="json"

[[outputs.influxdb_v2]]
  urls = ["http://yourinfluxdbserver:8086"]
  ## Token for authentication.
  token = "yourtoken"
  ## Organization is the name of the organization you wish to write to; must exist.
  organization = "yourorganisation""

  ## Destination bucket to write into.
  ## Change it but update the dashboard accordingly (hint: find/replace into the grafana dashboard  json before importing it)
  bucket = "XRRMonitoring"
```

## *gpuPerformanceStatistics* usage

 ```
 > gpuPerformanceStatistics --help
 
 Usage: gpuPerformanceStatistics className
 ```
 
 On Intel and Apple silicon macs you can use the classname *IOAccelerator* to be safe or you can be more specific with something like *AMDRadeonX6000_AMDNavi23GraphicsAccelerator* (if you have multiple GPUs. **ioreg -l** is your friend to find your targets...)

## Main AMD GPU metrics (and more)

* Core Clock (*MHz*)
* Memory Clock (*MHz*)
* Total Power (*W*)
* Device Utilization (*%*)
* Temperature (*C*)
* Fan Speed (*%*)
* Fan Speed (*RPM*)
* GPU Activity (*%*)

## Apple Silicon metrics (that's all)

* Device Utilization
* Renderer Utilization 
* Tiler Utilization
* Alloc system memory
* In use system memory
